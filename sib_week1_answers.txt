QUESTION: What is a route, and how do you specify one in Flask? 
ANSWER: A route binds a function to a URL, so that when you call the URL (incl. the port) in the browser, it runs the app that you previously executed to run on that particular port.  


QUESTION: What is the only route we've specified in our appication? 
ANSWER: Testingflast.py only has the main page defined ('/'), thus when you go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ it runs the function hello.


QUESTION: What is the method that gets called when we hit that route? 
ANSWER: It calls the __main__ method. 


QUESTION: If I wanted to add a route at "/world" that printed "Hello, World" on the screen, what would that code look like? 
# ANSWER: That code would like: 

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello Internet!"

@app.route('/world')
def world():
	return "Hello, World"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()


QUESTION: If I create a new application and import testingflask.py (a.k.a. I am not running it directly), will code under the 'if __name__ == "__main__":' be executed? Why not?  
ANSWER: If there's a name check (__name__ == "__main__") the code (app.run()) only executes when you run the module as a program--and not when it's imported as a module. If it's imported, then you have to call the functions themselves. This means that I can run the program above at http://127.0.0.1:5002/world, but if it's imported, "Hello, World" won't display. I'd have to add another line actually calling the fucntion app.run(). This is because python automatically sets up a set of variables when you run a script. The name check is one of these.
